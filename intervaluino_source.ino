// Intervaluino
// this code programs the Arduino as an intervalometer for a Canon EOS camera, using two relays and a push button
// this enables you to create time-lapse movies with your camera.
// change the variables "full_time" and "short_time"  to automatically calculate the right time interval (based on 25 frames per second)
// upload the code via USB, fire up the Arduino, plug it into your camera's remote shutter release, and press the Intervaluino push button.
// press the button another time to stop the sequence (doesn't work that well if your interval is long)
// make sure to turn on single shoot
